## What is Mijn-UI?

Mijn-UI is all about providing developers like us with more flexibility and control when building UI components. It offers:

- **Styled and Unstyled Variants**: Adapt components to match your design preferences, whether you're using predefined styles or building from scratch.
- **Multiple Design Options**: Mijn-UI offers more variant options to fit a variety of design systems.
- **Built for Flexibility**: Our focus is on providing flexible, reusable components that developers can easily extend or adapt to suit their needs.

## Project Status

We’re still in **beta** and actively working on refining the components. The **npm package** is not yet available, but we’re making steady progress. With constant updates and improvements, we aim to deliver a robust and user-friendly library soon.

## Contribute and Collaborate

Mijn-UI is an **open-source** project, and we welcome community contributions. Whether you're interested in trying out our library, providing feedback, or contributing code, we’d love to collaborate and improve Mijn-UI together.
